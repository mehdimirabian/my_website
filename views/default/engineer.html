                        such as user and password, and certificate path to the certificate file for security purposes of
                        a request call, and in return they returned the value that the function would return in HBase
                        command line.

            Starting college I had one vision and that was learning the world of computers and Software Development
            thoroughly, and West Valley College was the place for me. I needed to start the field from the ground up
            and I did so taking many valuable and informative courses related to the world of engineering and
            computers and many other General Education classes alongside those major-related classes as they were
            needed to help me develop as a professional student, and also as a professional software engineer.
            Although I took most of my pre-UCSC classes at West Valley College, Mission College's Physics department
            had a very much well-educated, and informative group of professors, which convinced me to continue my
            education learning more about physics and engineering taking 5 classes at Mission College including
            Physics: Mechanics, Physics: Electromagnetic, Physics: Thermodynamics and Optics, Engineering: Circuit
            Analysis, and Mathematics: Differential Equations.
